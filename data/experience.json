        "description": "As an Electronic Engineering student, I was involved in the Field Work Practice which is indeed mandatory for students of Semarang State Polytechnic. I did Field Work Practice/Internship at PT Pura Barutama Offset Unit located on Jalan Jatimulyo, Jati Wetan, Jati District, Kudus Regency. I was placed in the technician department there. My job was to make repairs related to the electricity that occurred in the machines there, an example of the repair I did was the repair of the UV heater on the Speedmaster CD 102-6 printing machine. However, during the internship I did not always work on the electrical part, sometimes I also worked on the mechanical part and the workshop part, this was very good because we got to know everything, not just the electrical part."
